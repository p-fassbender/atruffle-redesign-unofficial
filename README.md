The redesign focuses on improving the website's aesthetics, responsiveness, and overall functionality.

## Acknowledgments
This project is a personal redesign of the original website for Truffles. The goal was to reimagine the user experience and modernize the visual design based on the current structure and content of the existing site. While this redesign is entirely my own work, I want to acknowledge and give credit to the original website as the inspiration behind this project.

I have great respect for the work done on the original site and used it as a starting point for exploring new design possibilities. This project was not commissioned, and I have not been compensated for my work.
